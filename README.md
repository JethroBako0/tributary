# Tributary
This repository contains all work completed during the Ford Virtual Work Experience program. This is a project on the backend development of Fordâ€™s sensor streaming system

## Project 

This repository includes assignments and tasks for implementing a simulated Flask server for sensor data streaming. The codebase demonstrates the following:

**Data Recording:**
   - A `/record` endpoint for collecting sensor data posted by embedded systems in a vehicle.
   - Data is stored in a Redis database for efficient storage and retrieval.

**Data Retrieval:**
   - A `/collect` endpoint for retrieving the recorded sensor data, intended for user-facing mobile applications.

## Key Features

- Backend built using Python's Flask framework.
- Integration with Redis for database storage.
- Simple, modular code structure for ease of understanding and modification.

This repository will document all progress and serve as a foundation for exploring concepts related to embedded systems, backend development, and software engineering in the automotive industry.
